## About
This repo contains the data analylsis pipeline used to process the electrophysiological data found in the following publication:

**Huang JS**, Kunkhyen T, Rangel AN, Brechbill TR, Gregory JD, 
    Winson-Bushby ED, Liu B, Avon JT, Muggleton RJ,
    Cheetham CEJ. (2022). Immature olfactory sensory neurons provide behaviorally useful sensory input to the
    olfactory bulb. *Nature communications, 13, 6194 (2022).*

The project asks the question:
> **Do immature olfactory sensory neurons provide functional input to the olfactory bulb?**

Below is a brief overview of the analysis steps performed. For experimental results, please refer to the paper cited above.

## Data collection
Electrophysiological recordings were obtained using the [Igor](https://www.wavemetrics.com/)-based [MIES](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/MIES) software from superficial tufted cells (TC) in the olfactory bulb during optogenetic stimulation of olfactory sensory neurons (OSN).

## Data analysis

### Strength of OSN input onto individual TCs
The amplitude of excitatory currents recorded in TCs following optogenetic activation of OSNs were quantified.
